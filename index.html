        <h3>I come from a pretty big family; there are a total of nine in our household. I am the oldest of seven kids and the expecations that I am held to have always been high for that very reason. Choosing to pursure something that was not considered "profound" in the eyes of my parents was a choice that I needed to make for the sake of my personal and mental growth. I like to think that I am a vey spontaneous person due to the fact that I tend to just pick up and go and dont overthink. I absolutlely love to read and write. I always carry a journal with me wherever I go, in my car, and next to my bed. I love to document my thoughts, emotions, and dreams. Personally, I think it is so much easier to wrtie evreyrthing down than to physically try to explain. I also love to paint to destress and let my creativity take control. I actually have a wall filled with my work from over the years. I am also a gymrat. I love fitness and nutrtion and everything in between. I am actually working on a nutrtion and personal training certification. Fun fact, I love food and have a huge apetite. I have eaten 12 slices of pizza plus desert in one sitting. My most recent accomplishement was devouring a 4x4 from In - N - Out with fries and a shake. That's the jist of who I am! </h3>
